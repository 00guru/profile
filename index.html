    <h3><span>Title: </span>A Decentralized Blockchain-Based Authentication For IOT Systems:</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>
        Designed system creates virtual secure zones where each device possesses the zone
        key(unique to zone) identifying it as an authentic member to zone. If the zone doesn’t
        contain a master device any device can volunteer to be the master. The Master device has
        to register the zone onto the Blockchain and distribute signed tickets to devices that wish
        to join the zone by validating the requesting devices master key. Tickets issued by master
        provides member devices authenticity for future transactions with zone members. Only
        devices with valid tickets can communicate to other devices in the zone. Tickets can be
        validated as they are signed by master and zone creation can be verified by accessing the
        blockchain. Smart contracts are used for creation of groups, adding of new members and
        for message transactions. Communication i.e message transfer between devices are
        considered as transitions and must be validated by the blockchain. Devices can only
        communicate if they are members to the same zone. Smart contracts are set for device
        validation - to recognize and validate a device and a smart contract for communication
        rules preventing message exchange between devices in different zones. The power of the
        proposed approach relies on its suitability of the majority of IoT scenarios and use cases.
        This designed system is deployed to every ioT device in the environment</h3>
